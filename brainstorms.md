# Roles Reversed

- villain perspective
- setting the scene & manipulating all the items
- what if you are the camera
    - bonus points if you're a really pissed off camera who hates the protagonist
- and also messing with the environment maybe
    - character relative to the camera? element of dragging?
- the last level is literally throwing MC under a bus

## Game Theme

- Regular Guy (need 3D model)
- pushing the guy around, he bumps into stuff, has to pick it up?
- a character trying to navigate a level, we are the obstacles?
- character's win condition: make it to a Goal (player lose condition)
    - Shiny, Flag
    - tiny levels with different obstacle sets
- character lose condition?? aka player win condition
    - thrown off the map
    - getting hit on the head

## Mechanics

- Input system (for kb, mouse, gamepad, touch? compatibility)
- Character animations
- Adding forces in directions (rigidbody)

## Levels

1. hit the player tutorial
2. knock player off map tutorial
3. simple puzzle

the last one throws them under a bus

## Platforming ideas

- character trying to die
- character trying to impede a protagonist

## RPG 

- character classes, flipped
- characters body switched
- has a lot of complexity potential
- your party is a group of goblins protecting camp from "heros"

# General game stuff

## Settings menu

- responsive positioning
